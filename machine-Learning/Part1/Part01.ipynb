    "1) Problem definition\n",

    "5) Feature selection and engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Problem Definition (What are we trying to solve?)\n",
    "👉 This means clearly understanding the goal of the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "You are given data from a grocery store, and you are asked:\n",
    "\n",
    "“Can you help us predict which customers will buy again next month?”\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ So your problem is:\n",
    "Predict if a customer will come back next month or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Data Collection (Getting the data)\n",
    "👉 This is the step where you gather information (called \"data\") to solve the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "To solve the grocery store problem, you collect:\n",
    "\n",
    "Customer names\n",
    "\n",
    "Their age, gender\n",
    "\n",
    "What they bought\n",
    "\n",
    "How often they visit\n",
    "\n",
    "How much they spent\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Now you have all the data in a file (like Excel, CSV, or database).\n",
    "\n",
    "3) EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) (Understand your data)\n",
    "👉 This step is about exploring the data:\n",
    "\n",
    "What kind of data do you have?\n",
    "\n",
    "Are there missing values?\n",
    "\n",
    "What patterns do you see?\n",
    "\n",
    "Are there outliers (strange or wrong values)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "You might find:\n",
    "\n",
    "Most customers are aged 25-40\n",
    "\n",
    "People who spend more than $100 usually come back\n",
    "\n",
    "Some customers have no age listed (missing data)\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ You use charts, tables, and graphs to understand the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Data Pre-processing / Cleaning (Fixing the data)\n",
    "👉 This means making the data clean and ready for use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "Fill missing values (e.g., fill age with average age)\n",
    "\n",
    "Remove duplicate entries\n",
    "\n",
    "Change text to numbers (e.g., \"Male\" → 1, \"Female\" → 0)\n",
    "\n",
    "Fix wrong or strange data\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "One customer has an age of 300 → That's wrong! Maybe it was 30.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another customer has no gender listed → Fill it with “unknown” or the most common gender.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Clean data = better model results.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Feature Selection and Engineering (Choose useful data & make new features)\n",
    "👉 This step is about picking the important columns (features) and creating new ones that help in solving the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature selection = Pick useful columns\n",
    "Feature engineering = Create new smart columns\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "You keep useful features: Age, total spending, visit frequency\n",
    "\n",
    "You create a new feature: \"Spending per visit\" = Total spending / Number of visits\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ This helps your model understand customers better.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Summary in 1 Line Each:\n",
    "Step\tMeaning\n",
    "1) Problem Definition\tWhat are we trying to predict or solve?\n",
    "2) Data Collection\tGather the needed data from files or sources\n",
    "3) EDA\tLook at the data and understand it using graphs and stats\n",
    "4) Data Cleaning\tFix missing, wrong, or messy data\n",
    "5) Feature Engineering\tChoose or create smart columns to help your model"
